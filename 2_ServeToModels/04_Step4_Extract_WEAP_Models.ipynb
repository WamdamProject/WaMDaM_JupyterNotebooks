So to make it easy for you, I'll ask you to connect to SQL file database that I already loaded from those workbooks. If you're interested in loading them yourself, you're welcome to contact me. In the meantime, I recommend you read WaMDaM paper and visit its Jupyter Notebook here https://github.com/WamdamProject/WaMDaM_JupyterNotebooks/tree/master/1_QuerySelect\n",
